The return code for the `binary_search` function you're asking about would be annotated to indicate that the function might return an `int`, representing the index of the target in the array, or `None`, if the target is not found. Here is the function signature with the return type annotation:

```python
from typing import Optional

def binary_search(arr: list, target: int) -> Optional[int]:
    pass  # Function implementation goes here
```

The `Optional[int]` type hint from the `typing` module indicates that the `binary_search` function could return an integer (the index of the target if found), or `None` (if the target is not in the list).
